# Demo instructions

1. Go to [Azure AI Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com), starting with the main dashboard where we can choose speech by scenario or create custom capabilities for our need.
1. Now, select **Text to speech avatar** feature. This tool allows us to create our own text to speech avatar.
1. Select the avatar of your choice.
1. Add a few sentences to test this out such as "Hi, I'm Lori. Welcome to Microsoft AI Tour. It's a pleasure meeting you all here."
1. Then select the voice of your choice for the avatar and select **Preview video**.

As you see in the video, the avatar already have some gestures naturally added, if you want to add more gestures you can select them from the dropdown.

1. Let’s try this in a different language, preferably the native language of the AI Tour destination.
1. Select the language and update the text in language you've selected.
1. Recognize that after changing the language, voice options changed as well, you can also select the voice of your choice.
1. Select **Preview video** again and there we go. The avatar now speaks in language of your choice.

Finally, scroll down in the page to show that this is all available as a code snippet to customize further and it’s also available on GitHub.
